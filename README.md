## Contributing

- Branch `master` is for production-ready code and cannot be pushed to. Open a PR and code will be merged into `master` once it's approved.
  - _Note_: rule will be enforced once project reaches version `1.0.0`.
- Branch `develop` is for working on next release. That's the place to branch off from when working on new features or non-critical bug fixing.
- In general, the project follows [this](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) git flow with some tweaking:
  - During initial development phase, `release` branches can be skipped and code can be merged directly from `develop` into `master`.
